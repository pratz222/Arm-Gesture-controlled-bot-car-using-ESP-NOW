# Arm Gesture-Controlled Bot Car Using ESP-NOW

## Overview
The **Arm Gesture-Controlled Bot Car** allows users to control a robotic car's movements effortlessly by using hand gestures. This project harnesses the power of ESP-NOW technology, enabling wireless communication and seamless control. Imagine directing a robot car with just a wave of your hand!

## Key Components
- **ESP32 Module**: A versatile wireless module equipped with dual-core processing capabilities, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth functionalities.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: A robust motor driver used to control the bot's motors for movement.
- **MPU6050**: An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor responsible for detecting hand gestures.
- **3.7V Lithium-Ion Batteries**: The power source for the bot, ensuring portability and ease of use.

## Features
- **Wireless Control**: Utilizes ESP-NOW technology for efficient and low-latency communication.
- **Gesture Recognition**: The MPU6050 detects and interprets various hand gestures to control the bot's movements.
- **Intuitive Operation**: Easily control the bot by simply moving your hand in predetermined gestures.
